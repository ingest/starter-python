# Ingest/Flask Sample App

## Introduction

**Example Ingest client applications using Python/Flask.**

Included are two sample apps using both Client Credentials and Authorization Code Grant (OAuth2) to help quick start development with Ingest's API. Refer to [Ingest's documentation](https://github.com/ingest/api-reference) for more information on what else you can do with Ingest!

## Usage

It's recommended you use a virtual environment when installing the dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ingest/starter-python.git
# From the directory, choose the application you'd like to use.
cd client-based-authorization
# Install dependencies with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run the app
python app.py
```
